## Products Management System
# Description
The Products Management System is a comprehensive solution consisting of two projects: an ASP.NET Core Web API designed to manage products and a Blazor WebAssembly project serving as the client or UI to consume the API. The API project encompasses functionalities related to products such as controllers, model classes, and database connections. On the other hand, the Blazor WebAssembly project provides an interactive user interface to interact with the products API, enabling smooth management of product data.

## Features

-- Implements RESTful endpoints for CRUD operations on products.
